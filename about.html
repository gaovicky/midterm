        <!--Description about -R- album-->
        <div class="Text2">
          <p>Rosé’s debut solo single album -R- was released on March 12, 2021. This
            album allowed the K-Pop singer to reflect where she has come and to
            set a reminder of what motivates her. In BLACKPINK’s 2020 Netflix
            documentary ‘Light Up The Sky,’ Rosé revealed she worked up the
            courage to be vulnerable and write something on her own.
          </p>
          <p>She explains that her lead track "On The Ground" captures her
            journey from being a trainee to being a member of BLACKPINK. Her
            other song, “Gone,” echoes the pain she experienced during a
            difficult breakup.
          </p>
          <p>She hoped -R- would cheer up her fans during the pandemic.</p>
