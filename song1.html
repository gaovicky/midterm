        <p>[Verse 1]</p>
        <p>My life's been magic, seems fantastic</p>
        <p>I used to have a hole in the wall with a mattress</p>
        <p>Funny when you want it, suddenly you have it</p>
        <p>You find out that your gold's just plastic</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>[Pre-Chorus]</p>
        <p>Every day, every night</p>
        <p>I've been thinkin' back on you and I</p>
        <p>Every day, every night</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>[Chorus]</p>
        <p>I worked my whole life</p>
        <p>Just to get right, just to be like</p>
        <p>"Look at me, I'm never comin' down"</p>
        <p>I worked my whole life</p>
        <p>Just to get high, just to realise</p>
        <p>Everything I need is on the</p>
        <p>Everything I need is on the ground</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>[Post-Chorus]</p>
        <p>On the ground</p>
        <p>Everything I need is on the ground</p>
        <p>Nah, but they don't hear me though</p>
        <p>(Yeah, what goes up must come down)</p>
        <p>Nah, but they don't hear me though</p>
        <p>(You're runnin' out of time)</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>[Verse 2]</p>
        <p>My world's been hectic, seems electric</p>
        <p>But I've been wakin' up with your voice in my head</p>
        <p>And I'm tryna send a message and let you know</p>
        <p>That every single minute I'm without you, I regret it</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>[Pre-Chorus]</p>
        <p>Every day, every night</p>
        <p>I've been thinkin' back on you and I</p>
        <p>Every day, every night</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>[Chorus]</p>
        <p>I worked my whole life</p>
        <p>Just to get right, just to be like</p>
        <p>"Look at me, I'm never comin' down"</p>
        <p>I worked my whole life</p>
        <p>Just to get high, just to realise</p>
        <p>Everything I need is on the</p>
        <p>Everything I need is on the ground</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>[Post-Chorus]</p>
        <p>On the ground</p>
        <p>Everything I need is on the ground</p>
        <p>Nah, but they don't hear me though</p>
        <p>(Yeah, what goes up must come down)</p>
        <p>Nah, but they don't hear me though</p>
        <p>(You're runnin' out of time)</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>[Bridge]</p>
        <p>I'm way up in the clouds</p>
        <p>And they say I've made it now</p>
        <p>But I figured it out</p>
        <p>Everything I need is on the ground (Yeah,yeah)</p>
        <p>Just drove by your house (Just drove by your house)</p>
        <p>So far from you now (So far from you now)</p>
        <p>But I figured it out</p>
        <p>Everything I need is on the</p>
        <p>Everything I need is on the ground</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>[Outro]</p>
        <p>On the ground</p>
        <p>Everything I need is on the ground</p>
        <p>Nah, but they don't hear me though</p>
        <p>On the ground</p>
        <p>Nah, but they don't hear me though</p>
        <p>Everything I need is on the ground</p>
