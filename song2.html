        <p>[Verse 1]</p>
        <p>I thought that you'd remember, but it seems that you forgot</p>
        <p>It’s hard for me to blame you when you were already lost</p>
        <p>Oh, yeah</p>
        <p>I'm tired of always waiting</p>
        <p>Oh, yeah, yeah</p>
        <p>I see you changed your number, that's why you don’t get my calls</p>
        <p>I gave you all of me, now you don't wanna be involved</p>
        <p>Oh, yeah, yeah</p>
        <p>I really gotta face it</p>
        <p>Oh, yeah, yeah</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>[Pre-Chorus]</p>
        <p>I just wanna be the one</p>
        <p>But to you, we're already done</p>
        <p>Tell me, why'd you have to hit and run me?</p>
        <p>Now I'm all alone, cryin' ugly</p>
        <p>You broke my heart just for fun</p>
        <p>Took my love and just left me numb</p>
        <p>Now it's eight in the morning</p>
        <p>Hate in the morning (All because of you)</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>[Chorus]</p>
        <p>Another story that's sad and true</p>
        <p>I can feel the pain, can you?</p>
        <p>You had to be the one to let me down</p>
        <p>To colour me blue</p>
        <p>Hate to see you with someone new</p>
        <p>I’ll put a curse on her and you</p>
        <p>Ain’t no looking back, now you're dead and gone</p>
        <p>My love is gone too</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>[Post-Chorus]</p>
        <p>All my love is go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-one</p>
        <p>All my love is go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-one</p>
        <p>All my love is go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-one</p>
        <p>All my love is gone</p>
        <p>Now you’re dead and gone</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>[Verse 2]</p>
        <p>All my love is gone and the hate has grown</p>
        <p>Standing all alone and I'm searching for something</p>
        <p>But I can't feel nothing</p>
        <p>I pack my bags and go</p>
        <p>This don't feel like home</p>
        <p>Too much darkness for a rainbow, I feel so used</p>
        <p>How am I supposed to live without you? I refuse, yeah</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>[Pre-Chorus]</p>
        <p>I just wanna be the one</p>
        <p>But to you, we’re already done</p>
        <p>Tell me, why'd you have to hit and run me?</p>
        <p>Now I'm all alone, cryin' ugly</p>
        <p>You broke my heart just for fun</p>
        <p>Took my love and just left me numb</p>
        <p>Now it's eight in the morning</p>
        <p>Hate in the morning (All because of you)</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>[Chorus]</p>
        <p>Another story that's sad and true</p>
        <p>I can feel the pain, can you?</p>
        <p>You had to be the one to let me down</p>
        <p>To colour me blue</p>
        <p>Hate to see you with someone new</p>
        <p>I’ll put a curse on her and you</p>
        <p>Ain’t no looking back, now you're dead and gone</p>
        <p>My love is gone too</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>[Post-Chorus]</p>
        <p>All my love is go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-one</p>
        <p>All my love is go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-one</p>
        <p>All my love is go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-one</p>
        <p>All my love is gone</p>
        <p>Now you’re dead and gone</p>
